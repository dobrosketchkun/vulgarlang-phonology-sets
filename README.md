# VulgarLang Phonology Settings
A collection of additional language phonology settings for use with [VulgarLang](https://www.vulgarlang.com/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repo or download the file you want
2. Go to VulgarLang -> Save Your Language -> Load settings
3. Select the phonology settings you want to use (from a file or the repo)
4. Generate a new language!

On Windows, make sure your file browser is set to "All Files" otherwise you will not be able to see the files in the repo.  VulgarLang uses plain-text formatted JSON, I just formatted it and saved it with the extension so it is easier to use and manually modify.
